## Download

### Git Clone (Recommended)

If you have Git installed on your server, this will be the easiest way to install Cooldash so that you can quickly grab updates.

`git clone https://github.com/otatechie/happy-dash.git`

To update moving forward, you'll just run `git pull` to grab the latest.

### Download Source

When you download the source, you're going to download a zip file containing all of the Cooldash files. Download the the latest release from Github.
You'll then unzip the archive to your new Cooldash installation directory.

## Install Dependencies

Once you have the source downloaded, you'll need to run `composer install` to install all of the dependencies.

## Configure Environment

Next, you'll need to copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the values with your own. This section is where you edit configuration file to reflect your own settings, such as your database credentials.

### Required App Settings

In your `.env` file, you'll need to set the following values:
`FILESYSTEM_DISK=public`  and in your `config/filesystems.php` file, you'll need to set the `public` disk to the following:

```php
  'public' => [
            'root' => public_path('uploads'), // or wherever you want to store the files
        ],
```

## Finalizing Installation

You should install and build all of the front-end dependencies and migrate your database.

``` bash
npm install
npm run build
php artisan migrate
```

## Authentication

Laravel Cooldash comes with login, two-factor login, registration, password reset, and email verification out of the box. Under the hood, the authentication portion of Cooldash is powered by [Laravel Fortify](https://github.com/laravel/fortify) package.

## Registration  

Before anyone can use your application, they need to create an account. Email verification is disabled, we recommend enabling it by following the Laravel Fortify documentation. By default, the `rule` requires a password that is at least eight characters in length and contains at least one uppercase and one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.
You can change this rule by following Laravel's [validation rule](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/validation#validating-passwords) guide.

>ðŸ’¡ Go to  `app/Actions/Fortify/CreateNewUser.php` and change the `rule` object

### Profile Management

Cooldash profile management features are accessed by the user using the top-right user profile navigation dropdown menu.

### Two Factor Authentication

Cooldash security features are accessed by the user using the top-right user profile navigation dropdown menu. Add an extra layer of security to your account using two-factor authentication by clicking the enable button.

### Authentication Log

You can view all of the authentication events. Under the hood, Cooldash uses [Laravel Authentication Log](https://github.com/rappasoft/laravel-authentication-log) package which tracks your user's authentication information such as login/logout time, IP, Browser, Location, etc. as well as sends out notifications via mail, slack, or sms for new devices and failed logins.
>ðŸ’¡ Please read the documentation of [Laravel Authentication Log](https://github.com/rappasoft/laravel-authentication-log)

### Auditing

There is detailed auditing capabilities for Eloquent models. Under the hood, Cooldash uses [Laravel Auditing](https://github.com/owen-it/laravel-auditing), allowing you to keep track of changes made to records, as well as any changes to their attributes.
